	/*
	* take intro to game programming "is like programming 3"
	* 
	* Waterfall Model
	* one stage leads to the next. 
	* no going back. 
	*	
	* V-Model
	* testing phase after each development phase
	* 
	* Spiral Model
	* 4 distinct stages
	* not quite sure how to define what the goals are
	* each time you spiral around the model, you have new ideas
	* but each spiral is very time and resource heavy
	* 
	* Agile Model/Method
	* SCRUM -- 
	* Spiral with smaller spiral
	* Made up of "sprints" 
	* each sprint deploys something model
	* then you review the product 
	* then you start another sprint 
	* 
	* usually 2-4 weeks
	* 
	* UNIT TESTING
	* smallest chunk of a program that does not depend on other code.
	*
	need to know what you want the output to be in order to test it 
	*
	does the unit test give you the outcome you want or expect

	unit testing is usually in a seperate projecct 

	create a unit test -> have to tell the unit test what project its referencing 
	* 
	* modify properties to make sure the test knows
	* VC++ Directories-> where the header files are located
	* Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies(Class.obj) ->.OBJ filefrom the debug directory 
	* Linker -> General -> Additional Library Dependencies -- debug folder? 
	* 
	* try and test multiple	possibilities of user or situational things that may happen
	it also may be wise to test the extremes of the program
	it also may me wise to test to see if the program can handle the wrong input

	Assert:: is the library that is used to test the program
